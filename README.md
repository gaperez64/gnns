# Graph Neural Networks for Bisimulation

We implement a GNN-based bisimulation computation for large graphs coming from
the Hardware Model Checking Competition (HWMCC) and the Reactive Synthesis
Competition (SYNTCOMP). All [benchmarks
considered](https://github.com/SYNTCOMP/benchmarks/tree/master/aiger) are in
the AIGER format.
